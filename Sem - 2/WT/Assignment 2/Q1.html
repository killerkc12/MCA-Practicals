            <h1>W3C Revises Website</h1>
            <p>
                Today the W3C launched its new Web site. This update follows the beta site announcement earlier this year. The new site features a harmonized design, simplified information architecture, new style for technical reports, and new content, including calendars and aggregated blogs. Visitors to the site will notice that ther are (new) pages that have not yet been completed with up-to-date content. The W3C plan to continue to add content to these W3C at site comments@w3.org if you would like to contribute, or if you find any bugs or anomalies. For students in CIS 4004 - the validators are now found on the right-hand side of the page, near the bottom.

            <h1>Students Voice Displeasure With HTML/CSS Validators</h1>
            <p>
                (September 30- CIS reporter) Many students have voiced their frustrations of using HTML and CSS validators to validate class projects in CIS 4004. Citing primarily the difficulties in understanding what the validator was trying to tell them. One student claimed "wtf does "OMITTAG NO was specified even mean?" We spoke to the instructor of the course, Dr. Mark Llewellyn, who stated that "validation is an important part of the proper design of a modern website and understanding the output from the validators comes with experience." Dr. Llewellyn noted that currently all correct HTML5 documents would still generate one validation warning that reads The validator checked your document with an experimental feature: HTML5 Conformance Checker. This feature has been made available for your convenience, but be aware that it may be unreliable, or not perfectly up to date with the latest development of some cutting-edge technologies. If you find any issues with this feature, please report them. Thank you Dr. Llewellyn stated that this warming is to be expected as HTML5 is not yet technically an offical standard
